Language

Immutable by default must declare mut explicitly for each variable.
let x = 5;  vs  let mut x = 5;

Associated functions - String::new() syntax for calling a function
associated with a type, generally would call this a static method.

References use & and are immutable by default so you often have to
use mut on them. &mut varname.

Match - a lot like a switch

match number {
    1 => println!("One!"),
    2 => println!("Two!"),
}

Errors and successes are dealt with by enumeration types so we often
use match's to do error handling.

let var : u32 = match inputstring.parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
}
